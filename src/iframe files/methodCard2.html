        <b>Prepare the Meat</b>
        <li>Gather the meat skewer ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place the onion in a food processor and process, scraping down the bowl occasionally, until completely pureed and juicy.  </li>
        <li>Remove from the food processor to a fine-mesh sieve set over a bowl, and press until almost all the juices have been removed. Reserve the onion juice.</li>
        <li>Place the onion puree in a medium bowl. Add the ground beef, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture by hand for up to 10 minutes to create a smooth paste-like consistency. This is a very important step to make sure the meat proteins have been properly bound and to ensure the meat paste will stay on the skewers.</li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the mixture for 60 minutes for proper marination and resting.</li>
        <li>Prepare a medium-high (450Â°F) charcoal or gas grill fire. If using a gas grill, be sure to start the coals about 30 minutes before grilling the kababs. If using a gas grill, make sure to have the grill turned on for 15 minutes prior to grilling.</li>
        <b>Make the Kabobs</b>
        <li>Gather the basting ingredients and prepared meat mixture.</li>
        <li>Divide the prepared meat mixture into 4 equal round pieces.</li>
        <li>Using the reserved onion juice, dampen your hands as necessary and place one portion of meat mixture against the flat edge of one wide metal skewer.</li>
        <li>Stretch and squeeze the meat mixture carefully along both sides of the skewer until you have a 6- to 7-inch long kebab, about 1/4 inch thick on each side. Make sure to thoroughly squeeze the meat mixture around the skewer to ensure you have a solid piece of kebab that is firmly attached to the skewer.</li>
        <li>Using your thumb and index finger gently press into the kebab to create uniform indentations that are about 1-inch apart. This step creates a traditional design as well as further ensures the meat mixture is firmly pressed into the skewers. Repeat with the 3 remaining pieces of meat.</li>
        <li>Combine the butter, onion juice, lemon, and salt in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until the butter has melted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Suspend the skewers over the charcoal and grill the kebabs until they are visibly darkened and seared while still remaining moist on the inside, flipping them every 30 seconds, 5 to 8 minutes total.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This quick flipping ensures that both sides of the meat begin cooking immediately and evenly in order for the meat to stay on the skewer. Do not overcook the kebabs.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Brush the kebabs with the basting liquid on both sides shortly before removing them from the grill. Place the skewers on a serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
