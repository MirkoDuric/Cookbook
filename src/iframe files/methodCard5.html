        <li>Wash and clean the meat, then chop it into equal cubic pieces. The even size of the chopped meat help better yet quicker cooking process. Then place them all into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Then peel the onions and wash them. When properly washed, grate the onions and remove the extra juice. Add the juice to the bowl of meat and discard the grated onions.</li>
        <li>Wash the lime or lemon. Split it into half. Remove the seeds and squeeze the lemon to take the juice out. Add the juice to the yogurt and add them both to the bowl of meat. Then add the salt, pepper and olive oil to the bowl and knead it with hands perfectly. In order to have the meat tasty, better to put a lid on the bowl and let it rest in the fridge for at least 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Then discard the bowl from the fridge and make them ready for cooking. Before putting the skewers through them, tenderize the meat. Then slide the skewers through the meat particles. Better to put one or two parts of the fat between the meat particles. It makes the kebab tastier.</li>
        <li>It is time to go for the charcoal. You need such flame to cook the Chenjes. If the content has been resting in the fridge for long hours, it will cook faster and much easier. You can have a skewer of tomato and chili peppers.</li>
