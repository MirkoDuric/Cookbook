        <li>In a large bowl, combine beef, lamb, and salt (plus other spices if you so desire)</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture with clean hands for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Cover the meat with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight</li>
        <li>Uncover the meat and stir in minced garlic and black pepper</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into small logs no longer or wider than an index finger  – it is best to do this with wet hands, so the meat does not stick to you. Keep wetting your hands after each few that you roll</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill. Ideally, you should use a charcoal grill</li>
        <li>Brush the grill with some olive oil</li>
        <li>Grill the minced fingers on a medium heat until evenly grilled and browned on all sides</li>
        <li>Serve warm with Turkish flatbread and freshly chopped onion (and ajvar if you have it!)</li>
    </ol>
