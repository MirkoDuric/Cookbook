        <li>Remove the octopus beak.</li>
        <li>Place the octopus in a large Dutch oven, cover with water and cook for 30 minutes with the unpeeled onion and especially no salt (it would harden the octopus).</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F/180C.</li>
        <li>Wash the potatoes, wipe with a cloth, and place in a baking dish sprinkled with coarse salt. Bake for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the octopus is cooked, remove from the water, drain and cut into pieces.</li>
        <li>Place in a large oven dish (earthenware if possible) with the cloves of garlic, bay leaf and cilantro and drizzle with olive oil.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes are cooked, shake off the excess salt, crush them very lightly with the fist, just to open them slightly, then place them around the octopus and sprinkle them generously with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake again for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season with freshly ground black pepper and serve immediately.</li>
