        <em>You can make this recipe one day prior</em>
        <em>Soaking time 1 hour or overnight</em>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200°C (180°C fan-forced). Brush two large shallow oven trays with oil to grease.</li>
        <b>For the Syrup</b>
        <li>Combine the sugar, water, lemon juice, cloves and vanilla bean paste in a medium saucepan and stir over medium heat until the sugar dissolves</li>
        <li>Bring to boil, reduce the heat to lowest possible heat and simmer gently, for 35 minutes or until the syrup thickens and reduces to about 900 ml.</li>
        <b>Meanwhile, For the Dough</b>
        <li>Use an electric mixer to beat the butter, sugar and orange zest until pale and creamy</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until well combined and smooth</li>
        <li>Sift together flour and baking powder into a bowl, then stir in the semolina</li>
        <li>Add to butter mixture and use a wooden spoon and then your hands to mix to a soft dough</li>
        <li>Roll about a tablespoonful of the dough into a log about and 2 cm wide and 6.5 cm long</li>
        <li>Press the log lightly onto the small hole-side of a box grater to flatten slightly to form a biscuit about 4 cm x 7 cm and about 1 cm thick and to create a pattern on the surface</li>
        <li>Gently peel the dough away form the grater and then use your hands to round the ends slightly to form an oval if needed</li>
        <li>Place on the greased baking tray</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining dough, placing about 2 cm apart</li>
        <li>Bake the biscuits for about 20 minutes, swapping the trays half way through baking until golden brown and cooked through</li>
        <li>Pour the hot syrup over the hot biscuits</li>
        <li>Set aside until the biscuits soak up most of the syrup (this will take about 30 minutes)</li>
        <b>Notes</b>
        <li>These biscuits will keep in an airtight container in the fridge for 2 weeks, with the syrup spooned over</li>
        <li>Serve straight from the fridge or at room temperature</li>
